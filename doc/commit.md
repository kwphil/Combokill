# Commits

**DO NOT COMMIT TO MAIN**

**Note:** Make sure your editor is set up for .editorconfig. If using VSCode, install the plugin for it

* Step 1: Switch to a different branch
* Step 2: Add your code
* Step 3: Request a merge to be talked about later
    * Add plenty of details of what you did
    * Be sure to add something to docs (including hotfixes!)
    * We can set up a meeting to agree to the merge

This is not to be demeaning, I will follow these steps as well! (To prevent as much undefined behavior as possible)
